    <h1>My Favorite Hobby</h1>

    <p class="up">
        My favorite hobby is going to the GYM. I started working out a few months ago and it has completely changed my
        life.
        The gym is not just a place to build muscles. it's a place where I build my mind and discipline.
        Every time I step into the GYM. I feel motivated and focused to push myself harder than before.
        Weight training improves my strength.
        I enjoy learning new exercises and tracking my progress every week.
        Working out also helps me relieve stress and stay confident.
        The best part is seeing the results of consistent effort. A stronger body, sharper mind, and better energy
        every day.
        Going to the gym has become a lifestyle for me and I can't imagine a week without it.
        It teaches me patience, determination, and self belief.
        I believe fitness is not just about looking good. it's about feeling strong, healthy, and unstoppable from the
        inside out.

    <p class="bp">
        Along with my workout routine, I love listening to music while exercising. 
        Music gives me extra motivation during workout. 
        It keeps my energy high and helps me maintain a good rhythm while lifting. 
        I also enjoy watching fitness videos and reading about new workout techniques. 
        Learning from professional trainers and athletes inspires me to keep improving myself. 
        My dream is to one day train others and share the benefits of fitness with everyone around me.
